Welcome to The Movie Reviewer!

This is the app my partner, Yoel, and I built for our Flatiron School Phase 2 project.

It's a simple movie reviewing app, where you can create and account, search a movie by title and write a review. 

You're also able to see a list of all movies that have been reviewed by other users and a list of reviews made for each movie.

### Ruby version
This app requires Ruby 2.6.1
